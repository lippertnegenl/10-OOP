Description:
In this homework we created code that would generate an .svg file that could be opened in the browser and generate 
a decal based on the your answers to the questions.  I found it great that there is a way to automatically generate
decals based on the answers to our questions because it really automates what could be a very tedious process.

Below is a link to my screenshot and a link to my repo as well as the walkthru video
